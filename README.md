#Age Verification Site

## User Story
### As any user:
- I want the website to be easy to read, with sufficient color contrast and font size.
- I want to have a dark mode option to avoid the burden from excess light that the screen emits.
- I want to input my birthday to verify if my age is eligible for the scheme.
  - If I am qualified, redirect me to a page that clearly states that I am eligible and presents me with all other information regarding the scheme.
  - If I am not qualified, redirect me to a page that clearly states that I am not eligible due to age restrictions, and provide a button to redirect me back to the homepage.
- I want to be able to click an icon on the navbar to return to the homepage from any page.
- I want a responsive website where the content is presented effectively on screens of different sizes.
- I want to use my older device to access the page without the need for the latest software to run it.


### As a visually impaired user:
- I want to have a screen-reader friendly webpage, where I can easily acquire the information of the content and navigate efficiently with the semantic HTML structure of the website.
- I want to be able to use the keyboard to navigate the site.

### As a user with limited arm mobility:
- I want to use the keyboard to navigate as I am unable to use a mouse.

### Dark mode option
Dark mode benefits
- Physical comfort reasons: To reduce eye strain when reading at night or in ambient conditions.
- Technical reasons: Dark mode saves power due to how the screen nits work
- Aesthetic reasons: Dark mode as design preference looks sleeker to some
- Medical reasons: For persons with migraine, light from screen is a trigger and are actually advised to avoid light and sound to reduce the pain
